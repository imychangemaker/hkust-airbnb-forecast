# Pricing Forecast: Airbnb Listings

Airbnb is an online marketplace focused on short-term homestays and experiences. The hosts on the platform often ponder what kind of listings are more popular and thus lead to a high booking rate. We aim to predict the popularity of airbnb listing using number of reviews based on listing attributes. We conduct the exploratory data analysis to look at the overall dataset distribution, followed by regression analysis. Based on the results, we provide several recommendation to existing Airbnb hosts such that they can promote various listing attributes effectively.
